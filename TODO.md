# Microservices Architecture Design TODO

> **Note:** This project is a design showcase and learning guide for modern microservices architecture. All items focus on abstraction, documentation, and demonstration of patternsâ€”not real infrastructure or production implementation.

---

## Advanced Saga & Workflow Patterns
- [ ] Design saga state persistence abstraction (ISagaStateStore) to illustrate how sagas survive restarts and resume workflows.
- [ ] Add timeout and compensation trigger abstractions for saga steps (e.g., demonstrate how compensation could be triggered if a step takes too long).
- [ ] Showcase parallel and conditional execution patterns for saga steps within the orchestrator.
- [ ] Illustrate event-driven saga progression (steps waiting for external events to proceed).
- [ ] Ensure idempotency and safe re-execution patterns for saga steps (track completed steps, allow retries in design).
- [ ] Document custom failure policy patterns for saga steps (retry, skip, escalate, etc.).

## Production-Grade System Design TODO

### Persistence & State Management
- [ ] Design durable database abstraction layers for all services (e.g., SQL, NoSQL in production).
- [ ] Document backup and restore strategies.
- [ ] Illustrate database migration patterns.

### Networking & APIs
- [ ] Add HTTP/gRPC API abstraction layers for all services.
- [ ] Document service discovery and registration patterns.
- [ ] Showcase API versioning and documentation strategies (Swagger/OpenAPI in production).

### Security
- [ ] Add authentication abstraction (OAuth2, JWT, etc.).
- [ ] Add authorization abstraction (RBAC/ABAC).
- [ ] Document transport security (TLS/SSL) requirements.
- [ ] Illustrate secrets management strategies for credentials.
- [ ] Document audit logging patterns for sensitive operations.

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Add centralized logging abstraction (e.g., ELK stack in production).
- [ ] Add distributed tracing abstraction (e.g., OpenTelemetry in production).
- [ ] Add metrics and alerting abstraction layers (Prometheus, Grafana in production).

### Deployment & Operations
- [ ] Document containerization strategies (Docker in production).
- [ ] Illustrate orchestration patterns (Kubernetes, Docker Compose in production).
- [ ] Document CI/CD pipeline design.
- [ ] Showcase zero-downtime deployment strategies (blue/green, canary).
- [ ] Document disaster recovery and multi-region support patterns.
- [ ] Illustrate cost and resource optimization strategies.

### Scalability & Reliability
- [ ] Add auto-scaling abstraction for stateless services.
- [ ] Document caching layer patterns.
- [ ] Add circuit breaker and fallback logic abstraction.
- [ ] Document dead-letter queue patterns for failed messages.

### Testing
- [ ] Document unit, integration, and contract testing strategies.
- [ ] Illustrate chaos testing patterns for resilience.
- [ ] Document automated test execution in CI/CD.
